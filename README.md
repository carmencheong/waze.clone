- location access screen

- google auto complete with ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-google-places-autocomplete )

- this app was two week sprint , 45 hours in total. If it was a real app, I would add the following:
- redux global state managment
- component folder for all the components.
- More navgiation animation.
- Real-time tracking for user destinations
- Recommending places based on user location.
